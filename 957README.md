# FIRST-957-Vision-and-Autonomous
This is an overarching repository containing code written by the programmers on the 
FRC Team 957 that we think other teams can use for advanced vision and autonomous code.

The code on here is a mix of WPI's and our own written to do additional vision processing
on the RoboRio. The sample code provided is a slimed down version of WPI's (Link on wiki
home page) that supports only USB cameras, but should work out of the box with even less
changes to make it a simple to use version of the code.
